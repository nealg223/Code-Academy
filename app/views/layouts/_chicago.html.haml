      Code Academy is located right in the heart of downtown Chicago.  The Code Academy office includes everything necessary for learning, in a neat array of iMacs positioned for pairs of users to collaborate on projects, all necessary software included. Access to this space after hours is given to all students to complete homework in a nurturing environment.

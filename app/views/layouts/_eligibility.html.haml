    %h1 { Motivation is key. }
    %h2#passion A practical approach to learning.
    %p As a beginner, it’s difficult and intimidating to attempt to learn computer programming. Why are the rare few that make it through completely self taught with little to no support?
    %br
    %p We created a better way. What was needed was a physical location that’s immersive and culturally accepting of beginners…

    %h2 Here it is.
    %p Located in the heart of Chicago, our program is fun, unassuming, and intense. You’ll learn more in 12 weeks than most do in a year. Our emphasis is on invigorating you to extract the knowledge necessary to build. Code Academy helps you take what’s in your head and make it real on the web.
    %br
    %p The core sessions take place every Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 8 a.m. to noon for 12 weeks. We provide you with everything necessary for effective coding: computers, software, and an environment that makes learning and productivity unavoidable.
    %br
    %p We will be using the Ruby on Rails web application framework to rapidly equip you with the tools and skills to start building. Some of the best companies are riding rails, and it’s one of the friendliest technologies for beginners to pick up in a short period of time.

    %h2 You are tenacious. 
    %p You can withstand the demand of a fast paced learning environment. You are diligent, focused and persistent in the acquisition of skills and knowledge. If you're quick to give up, this isn't for you. 

    %h2 You have capacity.
    %p You have "emptied your cup" and are ready to power up your skillset.

    /Immersion (elaborate, Neal.)
    
    /Most programming bootcamps are 4-day workshops that range from $1500 - $3000. Others are classes that are 3 hours a week for 8 weeks, and most are online-only, where it's up to you


    /We have a different approach. We believe that a focused time investment is necessary in order to learn how to code. 

    /With 12 hours a week of hands-on instruction led by an experienced and renowned software developer, as well as an army of mentors from the top software development shops, startups and investment firms in Chicago and beyond, Code Academy is an unprecedented program that gives you access to some of the most influential people in the city.
